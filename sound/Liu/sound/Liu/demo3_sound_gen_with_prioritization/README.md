Using GloVe for Word Classification in Python
This guide explains how to download and set up the GloVe word embeddings for use in our object classification project.

1. Download the GloVe File
Visit the official GloVe website:

GloVe Pretrained Word Embeddings
Download the glove.6B.zip file, which contains multiple versions of word embeddings.

Direct link: glove.6B.zip
Extract the downloaded .zip file.

You should see files like:
Copy
Edit
glove.6B.50d.txt
glove.6B.100d.txt
glove.6B.200d.txt
glove.6B.300d.txt
2. Move the File to a Known Path
Move the extracted GloVe file (glove.6B.100d.txt or any other dimension version) to a fixed location on your system.

Example Path:

makefile
Copy
Edit
C:\Users\YourUsername\Downloads\glove.6B\glove.6B.100d.txt
3. Update the Path in Your Code
Modify the glove_file_path in your script to match the actual location of the GloVe file:

python
Copy
Edit
glove_file_path = "C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Downloads\\glove.6B\\glove.6B.100d.txt"
Note: If you encounter FileNotFoundError, verify that the file exists at the specified path.

If you get UnicodeDecodeError, try opening the file using UTF-8 encoding:

python
Copy
Edit
with open(glove_file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
4. Load GloVe Word Embeddings in Python
Use the following code snippet to load the GloVe embeddings into a dictionary:

python
Copy
Edit
import numpy as np

embeddings_dict = {}
with open(glove_file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    for line in f:
        values = line.split()
        word = values[0]
        vector = np.array(values[1:], dtype="float32")
        embeddings_dict[word] = vector

print("GloVe embeddings loaded successfully!")
5. Using GloVe for Object Classification
We classify detected objects by computing the similarity between their word embeddings and predefined categories (e.g., Vehicles, Animals). This allows us to label urgent objects (such as vehicles) and prioritize them.

Example function for classifying words based on similarity:

python
Copy
Edit
def compute_similarity(word1, word2):
    if word1 in embeddings_dict and word2 in embeddings_dict:
        vec1 = embeddings_dict[word1]
        vec2 = embeddings_dict[word2]
        return np.dot(vec1, vec2) / (np.linalg.norm(vec1) * np.linalg.norm(vec2))
    return 0.0
To classify an object:

python
Copy
Edit
def classify_word(word, categories, similarity_threshold=0.5):
    for category, words in categories.items():
        if word in words:
            return category
        for predefined_word in words:
            similarity = compute_similarity(word, predefined_word)
            if similarity >= similarity_threshold:
                return category
    return "Uncategorized"
