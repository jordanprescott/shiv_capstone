🔊 Intelligent Sound Generation (sound_gen.py)
An enhanced audio dispatcher designed for clear, safe, and intuitive sound output in real-time object detection.

🚩 Key Features
No Overwhelming Repetition:

Objects will only announce again after:

Cooldown period: (default: 2 seconds) OR

Moving significantly closer: (default: 0.5 m or more)

Prioritizes Dangerous Objects:

Sounds for labels matching urgent keywords:

python
Copy
Edit
{"car horn", "horn", "siren", "alarm", "train", "vehicle", "engine", "motor"}
These play at a higher pitch (1500 Hz) and louder volume.

Distance-Based Volume:

Sound loudness decreases naturally with distance:

python
Copy
Edit
volume ≈ 1.0 / (distance + 0.1)
Audio Serialization (No Pile-ups):

Queues audio events, playing only one at a time.

Ready for Spatial Audio (HRTF):

Currently integrated with HRTF functions (can be easily toggled).

🛠 Usage (Integration in demo_7)
Simply call the following function for each detected object:

python
Copy
Edit
schedule_sound(obj_id, label, distance, x_angle, y_angle)
No further changes needed.
Dispatcher thread automatically starts on module import.

📂 Module Structure Overview
Component	Description
schedule_sound()	Decides when a sound should be queued (based on cooldown & distance).
_dispatcher()	Background thread; handles queued sounds in serial order.
Constants	Easily adjustable configuration at top of file.
Back-compat stubs	Old demos remain compatible without modification.

🎯 Quick Test (Validation)
Run the provided test script to check system behavior clearly:

bash
Copy
Edit
python schedule_sound_test.py
Expected sound sequence:

scss
Copy
Edit
person → horn → siren → horn (again after cooldown)
Clearly demonstrates debouncing and urgency prioritization.

⚙️ Configuration (sound_gen.py)
You can tweak the following values directly in sound_gen.py:

Constant	Purpose	Default Value
COOLDOWN	Minimum delay before re-announcement.	2.0 seconds
DISTANCE_STEP	Distance object must move closer to re-announce.	0.5 meters
SINE_LOW	Tone frequency for non-urgent objects.	400 Hz
SINE_HIGH	Tone frequency for urgent objects.	1500 Hz
DURATION	Length of each audio tone.	0.1 seconds

🚪 Graceful Exit
To safely stop the dispatcher thread on exit, add:

python
Copy
Edit
stop_dispatcher()
(Optional but recommended for clean program termination.)

✅ Compatibility Notes
To maintain compatibility with older scripts (demo3 to demo6), the following stubs are included:

generate_sine_wave(...)

play_sine_tone(...)

These legacy functions redirect internally to the new sound scheduler, avoiding errors in previous demos.
